# 🌐 Responsive Web Design Certification

freeCodeCamp – **Full Stack Developer Certification (Responsive Web Design Path)**

This repository contains my work, exercises, and projects from the **Responsive Web Design Certification** within the new **freeCodeCamp Full-Stack Developer Curriculum**.

Throughout this learning path, I built several hands-on projects to learn and practice the fundamentals of **HTML**, **CSS**, modern layout techniques, **accessibility**, and **responsive design**.

The goal of this path is to create real, clean, accessible, and responsive webpages using HTML and CSS — applying core concepts and developing the skills needed to build professional, user-friendly interfaces.
